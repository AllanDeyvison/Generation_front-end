                The lead character, called 'The Bride,' was a member of the Deadly Viper 
                Assassination Squad, led by her lover 'Bill.' Upon realizing she was pregnant
                with Bill's child, 'The Bride' decided to escape her life as a killer. 
                She fled to Texas, met a young man, who, on the day of their wedding rehearsal 
                was gunned down by an angry and jealous Bill (with the assistance of the Deadly 
                Viper Assassination Squad). Four years later, 'The Bride' wakes from a coma, and 
                discovers her baby is gone. She, then, decides to seek revenge upon the five people
                who destroyed her life and killed her baby.

                Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and 
                internationally-minded family. She is the daughter of Nena Thurman (née Birgitte 
                Caroline von Schlebrügge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain 
                retreat, and of Robert Thurman (Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and 
                academic who is one of the nation's foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma's mother was 
                born in Mexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who herself 
                was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma's father, a New Yorker, has English,
                Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry. Uma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, 
                where her father worked at Amherst College.

                Nancy Sandra Sinatra was born the first child of Frank Sinatra and Nancy Barbato Sinatra
                 on June 8, 1940 in Jersey City, New Jersey. Her first television appearance was with her 
                 father and Elvis Presley in 1959. She first appeared as a film actress in Juventude 
                 Desenfreada (1964) and Turma Bossa Nova (1964). Nancy appeared alongside Elvis in the 
                 musical comedy O Bacana do Volante (1968). She also had a successful career as a singer 
                 with two United States chart-toppers ("These Boots Are Made for Walking" and the duet with
                her father called "Somethin' Stupid") as well as numerous other chart entries including the 
                John Barry / Leslie Bricusse penned theme song to the James Bond film Com 007 Só Se Vive 
                Duas Vezes (1967). Lee Hazlewood wrote many of her songs and sang with her on some of them.
                By the early 1970s, she was covering new ground by recording songs from other writers such 
                as Bob Dylan, Smokey Robinson, Lynsey de Paul and Roy Wood. In recent years, Nancy has made a
                comeback also not hindered by the recent successful re-recording of "Somethin' Stupid" by 
                Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman.
